  I want to write a letter to you because I miss you so much.I don’t know why I look forward to think of you.The reason probably is I love you.
  Now, I am recalling my memory in which I went to the cinema in RenMin University of China with you and seated  corsair in Happy Valley Beijing and other many interesting things with you.I heard a sentence before--‘Life instead of the count of days you live, it is that days you remember.’ The every day with you is happy to me. I wish I can through the little life with you together.
  In the end, I have a great number of words to you but I have a problem in translating Chinese to English.So please forgive me for this.There is my favorite sentence from the movie ‘“I Belonged to You”— “I hope to have a person like you, the refreshing wind in the mountains, the warm light in the ancient city, from morning to night, from the mountains to the study, as long as the last is you.“
