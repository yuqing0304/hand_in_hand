# a letter for mute

- - -
* I love you! I will feel happy when you sent me a message or some voice , you read  English text to me, or you stay with me although do nothing.By the way,I tell you a secret that sometimes, I will laugh without control when I sent messages to you.Also, my mood will turn sad to fun when you are coming to my mind.
* In this day, I want to write a letter for you! So, I know you about six months from school beginning to now, but we are familiar with each other and feel love only two months.After staying with you, everyday is happy to me. I have a great number of wonderful things to finish with you together.Something like traveling many places with you, eating with you, looking after you and protecting you. We also will get trouble, such as quarreling, misunderstanding, boredom and so on. But that is the meaning of life, isn’t it? And I believe we can over come these problems like my father loving my mother.
* And to the end of this letter, I want to share a poem for you as a gift for the Valentine's Day.
* The most romantic thing is getting old with you and The most loving poem I heard is your messages.(writing by myself 0.0)
* Let’s begin our loving journey!
